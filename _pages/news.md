## News of 2021

* 05/2021: A first XAI paper of mine "BayLIME: Bayesian Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations" is accepted by [UAI2021](https://www.auai.org/uai2021/), thanks to the great efforts of my co-authors. BayLIME (here is [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03058)) is a Bayesian modification of LIME that exploits prior knowledge and Bayesian reasoning to improve the consistency in repeated explanations, the robustness to kernel settings and explanation fidelity.

* 05/2021: Our journal paper "Coverage Guided Testing for Recurrent Neural Networks" ([preprint](https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/id/eprint/3121687)) got accepted by [IEEE Tran. on Reliability](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=24). Congratulations to our star PhD student Wei Huang and all co-authors!

* 04/2021: An abstract paper is accepted by [DSN2021](http://dsn2021.ntu.edu.tw/index.html) -- "Detecting Operational Adversarial Examples for Reliable Deep Learning", here is a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.06015.pdf) version. Hopefully the more exciting parts, results to the research questions articulated, will come soon.

* 03/2021: Glad that our paper "Conservative Confidence Bounds in Safety, from Generalised Claims of Improvement & Statistical Evidence" is accepted by [DSN2021](http://dsn2021.ntu.edu.tw/index.html) (48 accepted out of 295 submissions -- 16.3%). Great work by my [CSR](https://researchcentres.city.ac.uk/software-reliability) colleagues Kizito and Lorenzo! Here is a [preprint](https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3119150/) version.

* 02/2021: It is my great pleasure to be part of the [UAI2021](https://www.auai.org/uai2021/) this year as a PC member. Looking forward to reviewing exciting papers from the prestigious community.

* 01/2021: Give a talk at the FOCETA WP3 workshop on behalf of our Liverpool side. The topic is on reliability assessment for Deep Learning software considering evidence of robustness verification and operational testing. 


## News of 2020

* 10/2020: About to start a new PDRA post at the Computer Science Department, University of Liverpool in Jan. 2021, working on a H2020 project [Foundations for Continuous Engineering of Trustworthy Autonomy (FOCETA)](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/956123) and a DSTL project [Safety Argument for Learning-enabled Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (SOLITUDE)](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~acps/projects/SOLITUDE.html) with [Prof. Sven Schewe](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~sven/) and [Dr. Xiaowei Huang](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~xiaowei/). Looking forward to it!

* 08/2020: Our journal paper "Assessing Safety-Critical Systems from Operational Testing: A Study on Autonomous Vehicles" (an extension of our [ISSRE2019 paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8987509)) is accepted by [Information and Software Technology](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-and-software-technology). Our friends from [CSR, City UoL](https://www.city.ac.uk/about/schools/mathematics-computer-science-engineering/research/centre-for-software-reliability) made a significant contribution. Here is a [preprint](https://x-y-zhao.github.io/files/IST_ISSRE2019_Extension.pdf) version.

* 07/2020ï¼š Our paper "Interval Change-Point Detection for Runtime Probabilistic Model Checking" is accepted by [ASE2020](https://conf.researchr.org/details/ase-2020/ase-2020-papers/31/Interval-Change-Point-Detection-for-Runtime-Probabilistic-Model-Checking). A first joint paper with our York friends at [TASP](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/tasp/) -- hopefully many more to come! Here is the [accepted manuscript](https://x-y-zhao.github.io/files/ASE2020.pdf).

* 04/2020: Our paper "A Safety Framework for Critical Systems Utilising Deep Neural Networks" is accepted by [SafeComp2020](http://safecomp2020.di.fc.ul.pt/). Many thanks to our Liverpool and DSTL friends for their great efforts. Here is a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05311.pdf).
