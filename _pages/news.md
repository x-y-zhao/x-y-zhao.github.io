* 06/2019: Our paper "Towards Integrating Formal Verification of Autonomous Robots with Battery Prognostics and Health Management", a joint work with colleagues from the University of Liverpool, is accepted by SEFM2019. Here is the [accepted](https://x-y-zhao.github.io/files/VeriBatterySEFM19.pdf) version.

* 02/2019: Presented our paper "Probabilistic Model Checking of Robots Deployed in Extreme Environments" at the 33rd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Honolulu, Hawaii, 2019. A preprint is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04128.pdf).

* 01/2019: As the start of my [AAIP](https://www.york.ac.uk/assuring-autonomy/) Programme Fellowship, I paid a very first visit to [Dr. Radu Calinescu](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~raduc/)'s team at the University of York, which was a great experience.
