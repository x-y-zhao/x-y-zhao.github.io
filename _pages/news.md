* 09/2019: Our paper "Drone Safety and Reliability Survey and Emerging Technologies Towards the Certification of Autonomous UAVs" is accepted by [ICSRS2019](http://www.icsrs.org/). Here is the [accepted](https://x-y-zhao.github.io/files/ICSRS2019.pdf) version.

* 07/2019: Our paper "Assessing the Safety and Reliability of Autonomous Vehicles from Road Testing", a joint work with colleagues from the [Centre for Software Reliability (CSR)](https://www.city.ac.uk/about/schools/mathematics-computer-science-engineering/research/centre-for-software-reliability) at City University of London, is accepted by [ISSRE2019](http://2019.issre.net/). Here is the [accepted](https://x-y-zhao.github.io/files/ISSRE2019.pdf) version.

* 06/2019: Our paper "Towards Integrating Formal Verification of Autonomous Robots with Battery Prognostics and Health Management", a joint work with colleagues from the University of Liverpool, is accepted by [SEFM2019](https://sefm2019.inria.fr/). Here is the [accepted](https://x-y-zhao.github.io/files/VeriBatterySEFM19.pdf) version.

* 02/2019: Presented our paper "Probabilistic Model Checking of Robots Deployed in Extreme Environments" at the 33rd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Honolulu, Hawaii, 2019. A preprint is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04128.pdf).

* 01/2019: As the start of my [AAIP](https://www.york.ac.uk/assuring-autonomy/) Programme Fellowship, I paid a very first visit to [Dr. Radu Calinescu](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~raduc/)'s team at the University of York, which was a great experience.
