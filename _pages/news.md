## News of 2021

* 03/2021: Glad that our paper "Conservative Confidence Bounds in Safety, from Generalised Claims of Improvement & Statistical Evidence" is accepted by [DSN2021](http://dsn2021.ntu.edu.tw/index.html) (48 accepted out of 295 submissions -- 16.3%). Many thanks to the great work my [CSR](https://researchcentres.city.ac.uk/software-reliability) colleagues Kizito and Lorenzo!

* 02/2021: It is my great pleasure to be part of the [UAI2021](https://www.auai.org/uai2021/) this year as a PC member. Looking forward to reviewing exciting papers from the prestigious community.

* 01/2021: Give a talk at the FOCETA WP3 workshop on behalf of our Liverpool side. The topic is on reliability assessment for Deep Learning software considering evidence of robustness verification and operational testing. 


## News of 2020

* 10/2020: About to start a new PDRA post at the Computer Science Department, University of Liverpool in Jan. 2021, working on a H2020 project [Foundations for Continuous Engineering of Trustworthy Autonomy (FOCETA)](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/956123) and a DSTL project [Safety Argument for Learning-enabled Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (SOLITUDE)](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~acps/projects/SOLITUDE.html) with [Prof. Sven Schewe](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~sven/) and [Dr. Xiaowei Huang](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~xiaowei/). Looking forward to it!

* 08/2020: Our journal paper "Assessing Safety-Critical Systems from Operational Testing: A Study on Autonomous Vehicles" (an extension of our [ISSRE2019 paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8987509)) is accepted by [Information and Software Technology](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-and-software-technology). Our friends from [CSR, City UoL](https://www.city.ac.uk/about/schools/mathematics-computer-science-engineering/research/centre-for-software-reliability) made a significant contribution. Here is a [preprint](https://x-y-zhao.github.io/files/IST_ISSRE2019_Extension.pdf) version.

* 07/2020ï¼š Our paper "Interval Change-Point Detection for Runtime Probabilistic Model Checking" is accepted by [ASE2020](https://conf.researchr.org/details/ase-2020/ase-2020-papers/31/Interval-Change-Point-Detection-for-Runtime-Probabilistic-Model-Checking). A first joint paper with our York friends at [TASP](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/tasp/) -- hopefully many more to come! Here is the [accepted manuscript](https://x-y-zhao.github.io/files/ASE2020.pdf).

* 04/2020: Our paper "A Safety Framework for Critical Systems Utilising Deep Neural Networks" is accepted by [SafeComp2020](http://safecomp2020.di.fc.ul.pt/). Many thanks to our Liverpool and DSTL friends for their great efforts. Here is a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05311.pdf).

* 02/2020: Give a talk at the [TASP: Trustworthy Adaptive and Autonomous Systems & Processes](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/tasp/) research group, University of York. The topic is "Robust Bayesian Estimators for Transition Parameters in Probabilistic Model Checking", here is the [slides](https://x-y-zhao.github.io/files/XZ_AAIP_presentation_AAAI2019.pdf).

## News of 2019

* 12/2019: Start a new project "[COVE: Continual Verification and Assurance of Robotic Systems Under Uncertainty](https://orcahub.org/engagement/partnership-fund/cove)" as a Co-Investigator. Looking forward to working with [Dr. Radu Calinescu](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~raduc/) and [Dr. Simos Gerasimou](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/simos/)!

* 11/2019: Our paper "On Reliability Assessment When a Software-based System Is Replaced by a Thought-to-be-Better One" is accepted by [Reliability Engineering and System Safety](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/reliability-engineering-and-system-safety). It is another joint work, during my PhD study, with colleagues from the [Centre for Software Reliability (CSR)](https://www.city.ac.uk/about/schools/mathematics-computer-science-engineering/research/centre-for-software-reliability) at City University of London. Here is a [preprint](https://x-y-zhao.github.io/files/NWTES_RESS.pdf) version.

* 09/2019: Our paper "UAS Operators Safety and Reliability Survey: Emerging Technologies Towards the Certification of Autonomous UAS" is accepted by [ICSRS2019](http://www.icsrs.org/). Here is the [accepted](https://x-y-zhao.github.io/files/ICSRS2019.pdf) version.

* 07/2019: Our paper "Assessing the Safety and Reliability of Autonomous Vehicles from Road Testing", a joint work with colleagues from the [Centre for Software Reliability (CSR)](https://www.city.ac.uk/about/schools/mathematics-computer-science-engineering/research/centre-for-software-reliability) at City University of London, is accepted by [ISSRE2019](http://2019.issre.net/) as a [Best Paper Nominee](http://2019.issre.net/node/79). Here is the [accepted](https://x-y-zhao.github.io/files/ISSRE2019.pdf) version.

* 06/2019: Our paper "Towards Integrating Formal Verification of Autonomous Robots with Battery Prognostics and Health Management", a joint work with colleagues from the University of Liverpool, is accepted by [SEFM2019](https://sefm2019.inria.fr/). Here is the [accepted](https://x-y-zhao.github.io/files/VeriBatterySEFM19.pdf) version.
