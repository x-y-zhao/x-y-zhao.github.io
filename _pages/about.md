This is Dr. Xingyu Zhao (Sing-You Jaw, if this was easier...).

I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/), University of Liverpool, as well as a Programme Fellow at the [Assuring Autonomy International Programme (AAIP)](https://www.york.ac.uk/assuring-autonomy/), University of York. Before I joined Liverpool, I was a member of the [Smart System Group](https://smartsystems.hw.ac.uk/), Heriot-Watt University.

I received both my Bachelor and Master degrees from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/). I joined the [Centre for Software Reliability (CSR)](https://www.city.ac.uk/about/schools/mathematics-computer-science-engineering/research/centre-for-software-reliability), City University of London as a PhD student and obtained a doctorate degree in Computer Science under the supervision of [Professor Bev Littlewood](https://www.city.ac.uk/people/academics/bev-littlewood) and [Professor Robin Bloomfield](https://www.city.ac.uk/people/academics/robin-bloomfield).

My research interests include (a changing list...):
* Probabilistic verification of autonomous systems.
* Bayesian inference with partial and/or vague prior knowledge.
* Software reliability assessment and safety assurance.
* Explainable AI.
* Modeling of software design diversity for fault tolerance.
