This is Dr. Xingyu Zhao (Sing You Jaw, if this is easier ...). I am a postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Smart System Group](https://smartsystems.hw.ac.uk/) at the [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/), currently working on the [Offshore Robotics for Certification of Assets (ORCA)](https://orcahub.org/) project.

I received my BEng in Software Engineering and MSc in Control Science and Engineering from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/). I joined the [Centre for Software Reliability (CSR)](https://www.city.ac.uk/about/schools/mathematics-computer-science-engineering/research/centre-for-software-reliability), [City, University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/) as a PhD student and obtained a Doctor degree in Computer Science under the supervision of [Professor Bev Littlewood](https://www.city.ac.uk/people/academics/bev-littlewood) and [Professor Robin Bloomfield](https://www.city.ac.uk/people/academics/robin-bloomfield).

My research interests include:
* Exploring the limits of what can be claimed rigorously for system dependability.
* Probabilistic model checking for autonomous systems.
* Assessment of "possible perfection" with respect to software faults.
* Modelling of software design diversity for fault tolerance.
